# 2048 Game

[Play Here!](https://rcwestlake.github.io/2048/)

###Description

2048 is a popular IOS and Android game. We built a web version using Javascript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Mocha, and Chai. To organize our code and development process, we used webpack. In addition, we used test-driven development (TDD) to approach the project and design the main functions and algorithms. 

The most challenging part of the project was figuring out the logic for moving tiles and combining values. 

###How To Play

To play our game in the browser, visit [2048](https://rcwestlake.github.io/2048/). The game should be ready when you arrive, simply click on the screen and use your arrow keys to move tiles. The goal is to combine like values and get as high as you can. The game ends when there are no possible combinations and the board is full. Best of luck!

###Local Storage

We store the high score in local storage so a user can keep track of how they have done.
